SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <optikus/watch.h>*

*oret_t  owatchAddDataHandler (const char $$*$$'filter', OwatchDataHandler_t 'phand', long 'param')*;


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Registers the value change handler and returns 'OK' on success. If a value
change handler with the same address is already registered or the library has
reached maximum number of registered handlers, the routine returns ERROR.

The 'filter' argument is not used in this version of the library. In future
library versions this parameter will be used to constrain the set of events
passed to the handler.

The 'phand' handler function shall have the following prototype:

*int dataHandler (long 'param', ooid_t 'ooid', const oval_t $$*$$'pvalue')*

The handler return value is ignored. When a monitored data value changes, the
library calls back the handler and passes it the user defined parameter, the
oid data sample identifier, and the new value. The handler should not change
the value structure fields. The *oval_t* structure has the following fields:
'type', 'len', 'undef', 'v', 'time'.

The 'type' field has *char* type and describes the data sample type (values in
brackets give the data length in bytes):
  *b* - signed char             (1),
  *B* - unsigned char           (1),
  *h* - signed short int        (2),
  *H* - unsigned short int      (2),
  *i* - int                     (4),
  *I* - unsigned int            (4),
  *l* - signed long int         (4),
  *L* - unsigned long int       (4),
  *q* - signed long long int    (8),
  *Q* - unsigned long long int  (8),
  *f* - float                   (4),
  *d* - double                  (8),
  *D* - long double             (16),
  *p* - executable code address (4),
  *E* - enumeration (similar to int, length is 4 bytes),
  *s* - variable length string (terminated by zero byte which is included
        in the length).
The data length referenced above is relevant for 32-bit architectures.
64-bit architectures are not yet supported by the library.
Also, the library does not support *q*, *Q*, *D* data types and passing
of raw byte arrays. Attempts to register or write unsupported data types
will make the library routine fail.

The 'len' field has *short* type and contains the data length in bytes
(most useful for strings).

The 'undef' field has *char* type and contains '0' if the value is relevant,
or '1' if subject cannot return the value (for example, if an object module
is reloaded and the new version does not contain the data sample). If subject
"drops" a data sample, the library calls change handlers as if the data was
changed, but marks the data as "undefined". If later the subject "acquires"
the data sample back, change handlers are passed the new data value with the
"undefined" mark reset.

The 'v' field contains the data value. It is a union of the following
subfields (symbols in brackets give the corresponding data "type"):
  v_char   (*b*),
  v_uchar  (*B*),
  v_short  (*h*),
  v_ushort (*H*),
  v_int    (*i*),
  v_uint   (*I*),
  v_long   (*l*),
  v_ulong  (*L*),
  v_float  (*f*),
  v_double (*d*),
  v_ulong  (*p*),
  v_enum   (*E*),
  v_str    (*s*).
The *p*-type value is an executable code address. It is an absolute memory
address valid only within the containing subject. Library passes it as a
32-bit unsigned integer number.
The 'v_enum' field is of *int* type.
The 'v_str' field has the *char $$*$$* type. When data handler is called,
this field points to an internal library buffer terminated by zero byte.
The handler should not change contents of this buffer or pass its address
to other user functions since the address can change from call to call.
If needed, the handler can create a copy of the buffer contents.
If data is undefined, the value field contains zero converted to the
corresponding type (for *v_str* this is *NULL* pointer).

The 'time' field has *long* type and contains the time of the last value
change or when the data last changed the "undefined" status in the containing
subject. The time is expressed in *v.t.u.*s (virtual time units).
In current version of the library this field is not used
and always contains zero.
