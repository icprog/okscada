owatchAddAliveHandler - ...


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <optikus/watch.h>*

*oret_t  owatchAddAliveHandler (OwatchAliveHandler_t 'phand', long 'param')*;


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This routine registers the subject state change handler. Returns 'OK' on
success. If a status change handler with the same address is already
registered or the library has reached maximum number of registered handlers,
the routine returns 'ERROR'. The state change events include transitions of
subjects from offline to online and back, server connection transitions
between established and shut down (these changes are tracked via the virtual
*$$*$$* subject), and the domain state switching between complete and incomplete
(tracked by the *$$+$$* subject, see the comment above).

The handler routine should have the following prototype:

*int aliveHandler (long 'param', const char $$*$$'subject_name', const char $$*$$'new_state')*

The handler will be called for the state changes occurring after the
registration. When a subject goes online or offline, the handler is called
with a user parameter, name of the subject changing the state and the new
status: TRUE or FALSE. The value returned by handler is ignores. If due to an
offline subject switching online all the permanent subjects become online, the
library generates the *online* event of the virtual "complete domain" subject
with the name of "*$$+$$*". If the domain is complete, and one of permanent subjects
goes offline, then before passing the subject switch event to handlers, the
library generates the *offline* event for the "*$$+$$*" subject.
