.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This routine changes the \fBauto_commit\fR library parameter. If the new value is \fITRUE\fR, and before the call there were unfinished modifications, their commit will be initiated automatically.
.sp
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Since the current library version supports only the \fBauto commit\fR mode, this routine accepts only the \fITRUE\fR argument value and returns \fIERROR\fR otherwise.
