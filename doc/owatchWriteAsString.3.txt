NAME
----
owatchWriteAsString - ...


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <optikus/watch.h>*

*oret_t owatchWriteAsString (const char $$*$$'desc', const char $$*$$'value', int 'timeout', int $$*$$'err_code')*;


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This routine performs a single modification of the data sample described by
'desc' without monitoring registration. The new 'value' is taken from the second
argument and converted to the target sample type. If the target sample has a
numeric type, the system attempts to treat the input string as containing a
decimal number. If the target sample is an integer number, the string
converted to a number is truncated. Current version of the library does not
check for possible minimum-maximum overflows, it is responsibility of the user
application. In such cases the converted data value is undefined, and the
error code is not set.


RETURN VALUE
------------
On success the routine returns 'OK'.
On failure the routine returns 'ERROR' and sets the error code appropriately.


NOTE
----
In future the library will support more strict type checks.


BUGS
----
See the Optikus distribution BUGS file.
