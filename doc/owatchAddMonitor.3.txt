NAME
----
owatchAddMonitor - ...


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <optikus/watch.h>*

*owop_t  owatchAddMonitor (const char $$*$$'desc', ooid_t $$*$$'ooid_buf', bool_t 'dont_monitor')*;


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This routine starts monitoring of a data sample.

The 'desc' parameter describes the data sample using the following syntax:

*$$[subject['/'module]'@']prototype$$*

The *prototype* string describes the data sample in the C language syntax.

By default the data sample is searched among all subjects registered with the
monitoring server. If there are several subjects or object modules containing
data with the same name, the system picks the first matching name, but the
search order is not determined. Using the optional *subject* and *module*
strings the data sample location can be fixed.

Whether the routine is blocking or not, is defined by the *async_timeout*
library parameter. The routine initiates the asynchronous operation
registering the data sample monitoring and returns the operation descriptor or
'OWOP_OK'/'OWOP_ERROR'. When this operation completes with success, the library
will store the unique data sample identifier at the address pointed to by the
ooid_buf argument. On failure (i.e. data sample is not found, the operation is
aborted or a system error occurs) the library will store 'OOID_NULL' at the
'ooid_buf' buffer. The *ooid_t* data type is defined in the *<optikus/watch.h>*
header.

The 'dont_monitor' argument tells whether value change handlers will be called
when this data sample changes:
- If 'dont_monitor' is 'FALSE', the handlers will be called at each change
  (however, this can be also controlled by the *owatchEnableMonitor()* routine).
- If 'dont_monitor' is 'TRUE', the data value can be obtained via the
  *owatchRead()* or *owatchGetValue()* routines.


RETURN VALUE
------------
On failure, or if any of the arguments is a *NULL* pointer, the routine
immediately returns 'OWOP_ERROR'.
Otherwise, the operation descriptor is returned.


NOTE
----
If the routine is called several times for the same data sample, it will
return the same data identifier each time increasing internal data reference
counter. Monitoring of the data will be enabled if at least for one of the
*owatchAddMonitor()* calls the 'dont_monitor' argument is 'FALSE'.
