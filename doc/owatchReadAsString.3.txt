owatchReadAsString - ...


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <optikus/watch.h>*

*char $$*$$ owatchReadAsString (const char $$*$$'desc', int 'timeout', int $$*$$'err_code')*;


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The routine performs single data sample reading from a monitored subject. On
success the routine returns value of the sample converted as a string. Numeric
data samples are converted into decimal fixed-point format. String data
samples are passed as is. The returned string is dynamically allocated by the
library and should be later freed by application by means of the standard C
library *free()* routine. In case of failure (data sample not found by
description or subject does not respond before deadline or a system error
occurs), the routine returns *NULL* pointer and sets 'err_code' appropriately.
