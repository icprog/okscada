NAME
----
owatchCommit - ...


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <optikus/watch.h>*

*owop_t  owatchCommit (void)*;


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This routine initiates the process of committing all the data modification
requests buffered in subjects. The actual commit operation will not start
until all previous commits get completed. Server and subjects together pick
the actual modifications commit time as a nearest possible time after
completion of the previous commits that satisfies system level constraints of
the server and the involved subjects. The user application can proceed with
the next invocations of *owatchWriteXXX()* immediately after this routine
returns, i.e. before the current commit completes, but new modifications will
be commited only by the next commit operation.


RETURN VALUE
------------
Since the current library version supports only the *auto commit* mode,
this routine always returns 'OWOP_ERROR'.


BUGS
----
See the Optikus distribution BUGS file.
