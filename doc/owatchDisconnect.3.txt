NAME
----
owatchDisconnect - ...


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <optikus/watch.h>*

*oret_t  owatchDisconnect (void)*;


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Disconnects from the *ohub* server.
All operations waiting for the hub will be canceled. Note, that if a disconnect
is not explicitly commanded by this routine but happens due to a hub restart
or a network failure, the operations are not canceled. In such cases the
library records waiting operations, repeats attempts to connect to the hub
and after successful connection the library re-registers data monitors and
completes the operations. The user, however, can cancel these operations
explicitly via *owatchCancelOp()*.


RETURN VALUE
------------
Returns 'OK', if the connection was established.
If the connection was not estableshed or not initialized, returns 'ERROR'.


BUGS
----
See the Optikus distribution BUGS file.
