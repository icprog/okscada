NAME
----
owatchCommitAt - ...


SYNOPSIS
--------
*#include <optikus/watch.h>*

*owop_t  owatchCommitAt (long 'vtu_time')*;


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This routine schedules committing of buffered modification requests at the
time given by the 'vtu_time' argument and expressed in *virtual time units*. The
involved subjects obey the requested commit time constrained by the precision
of their system clocks. The asynchronous commit operation will fail if at
least one subject cannot receive all the modification requests before the
given time. Calling *owatchCommitAt()* with argument which is less than one of
previous values of the same argument or is less than the current virtual
domain time, makes the routine immediately return with 'OWOP_ERROR'.


RETURN VALUE
------------
Since the current library version supports only the auto_commit mode,
this routine always returns 'OWOP_ERROR'.


BUGS
----
See the Optikus distribution BUGS file.
